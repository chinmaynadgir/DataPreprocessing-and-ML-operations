# Data Science Portfolio - Chinmay S Nadgir

## Overview

This repository contains five comprehensive, publish-quality Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate end-to-end data science workflows with a strong focus on practical, production-ready techniques. These modules cover:

### Module 1: Data Loading  
Techniques and best practices to ingest data efficiently from multiple file formats with robust error handling and memory optimization.

### Module 2: Data Preprocessing  
Systematic data cleaning, missing value treatment, outlier detection, feature engineering, and categorical encoding strategies.

### Module 3: Statistics & Probability  
Core statistical concepts including hypothesis testing, probability distributions, correlation analysis, and regression modeling with rigorous interpretation.

### Module 4: Data Visualization  
Design and implementation of static and interactive visualizations following best practices to enhance data understanding and communication.

### Module 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
A business-driven, end-to-end EDA workflow from data quality assessment to hypothesis testing, insights extraction, and actionable recommendations.

## Other Data Science Projects

In addition to the modules above, prior data science work includes foundational projects in data mining and machine learning covering:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Comprehensive handling of raw, noisy, and missing data; transformation methods such as normalization and discretization; and dimensionality reduction techniques for large datasets.

- **Algorithm Implementations:** Application of Apriori algorithm for association rule mining to analyze market basket datasets and discover frequent itemsets. Implementation of K-means clustering on insurance policy data for customer segmentation and risk analysis.

- **Datasets Used:**  
  - Grocery shopping dataset (~9,800 rows, 32 features) for frequent itemset mining and association analysis.  
  - Insurance policy dataset (~1,340 rows, 7 features) for unsupervised clustering and premium prediction.
